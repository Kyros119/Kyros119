- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kyros119
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and jump even more in the IT field besids being a Service Desk analyst. 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to code, also in school learn on Visual Studio C#. I'm enjoying the logic of coding and can't wait to see how much I have learned, and
where would I be in a few months.
