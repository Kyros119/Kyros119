- ðŸ‘‹ Console.WriteLine("Hi, Iâ€™m Kyros119");
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning to code and jump even more in the IT field besides being a Service Desk Analyst. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning to code, also in school learn on Visual Studio C#. I'm enjoying the logic of coding and can't wait to see how much I have learned, and
where would I be in a few months.
